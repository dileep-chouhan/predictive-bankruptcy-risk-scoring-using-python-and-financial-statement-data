# Predictive Bankruptcy Risk Scoring using Python and Financial Statement Data

## Overview

This project aims to develop a Python-based model for predicting the probability of corporate bankruptcy within the next year.  The model utilizes publicly available financial statement data to identify key financial ratios and indicators that are strongly correlated with bankruptcy risk.  The analysis involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation using appropriate machine learning techniques.  The ultimate goal is to create a reliable scoring system that can assist in assessing the creditworthiness and bankruptcy risk of companies.

## Technologies Used

* Python 3.x
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* (Add any other libraries used here)


## How to Run

1. **Install Dependencies:**  Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.  Then, install the required Python libraries using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Script:** Execute the main script using:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   This will run the entire analysis pipeline, from data loading and preprocessing to model training and evaluation.

## Example Output

The script will print key analysis results to the console, including model performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, AUC).  Additionally, the script will generate several visualization files (plots) in the `output` directory, such as:

* `sales_trend.png`: (Example plot -  replace with actual plot names generated) A visualization showing trends in sales revenue over time.
* (Add other plot descriptions here as needed)


## Data

The project utilizes [Source of your data, e.g., a publicly available dataset, a link to a CSV file, etc.].  Ensure that the data file is in the correct location as specified in the `main.py` script.  You may need to adjust file paths if necessary.
